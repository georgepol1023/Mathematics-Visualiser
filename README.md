# Enhanced Math Visualization GUI

This is an interactive Python GUI application for advanced mathematical visualization. It supports plotting multiple mathematical functions simultaneously, including polynomial, trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic, and hyperbolic functions, with customization for plot style and range.

## Features

- Plot multiple functions at once with multi-selection.
- Functions included: \(y = x^2\), \(\sin(x)\), \(\cos(x)\), \(\ln(x)\), \(e^x\), \(\sinh(x)\), \(\cosh(x)\), \(\tanh(x)\), and custom polynomials.
- Interactive sliders to adjust the x-axis range dynamically.
- Toggle between line and scatter plot styles.
- Save plots as PNG images.
- Clear, reset, and zoom reset buttons for convenience.
- Large, readable fonts for all GUI text elements.
- Friendly annotation with a stick figure on the plot.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.
2. Install required dependencies:

///bash
pip install matplotlib numpy sympy


## Usage

1. Run the Python script:


///bash 
python maths.py


2. Select one or more functions from the list on the right.
3. Adjust x-axis range using the sliders.
4. Choose plot style (line or scatter).
5. Use the buttons below to plot, clear, reset, save, or reset zoom.
6. Enter a custom polynomial expression as needed when selected.
